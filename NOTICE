Copyright 2025 Robin Bryce

This product includes software developed by the AWS SDK for Go v2 project
(https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2).

Portions of this software are based on the AWS SDK for Go v2 signer
implementation, specifically the AWS Signature Version 4 signing algorithm
found in:
  - github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws/signer/v4
  - github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws/signer/internal/v4

The AWS SDK for Go v2 is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
See the LICENSE file for details.

This implementation is a minimal reimplementation designed for S3-compatible
APIs (such as Cloudflare R2) without AWS SDK dependencies. Code comments
throughout the implementation reference the original AWS SDK implementation
and the AWS Signature Version 4 specification.
